  "homepage column 1": "<p> Welcome to the demo of Datafari Enterprise Search. The aim of Datafari is to simplify your daily life at work, by making it easy for you to search for documents and information throughout your company, without the hassle to look silos by silos.</p><p>To begin your search experience, just type one or more keywords in the search bar above, and let Datafari to the work for you. Since this is a demo, please check in the third column for some keywords that have results. Datafari will take you to a results list page, equipped with many functionalities such as facets to navigate through your results.</p><p>Datafari is secured by design, and as such you will only be able to search for the documents that you are allowed to view, and your communications are encrypted via ssl.</p><p>Enjoy your search!</p>",
  "homepage column 2": "<p>How to search</p><p>You are probably familiar with web search paradigms, and Datafari inspires from it so that your learning curve gest as short as need be. Similarly to what you can do with your daily web search, just type in one or more keywords in the search bar above.</p><p>By default, Datafari opts for a hidden AND operator, so it will look for the documents that contain all of your keywords, unless you explicitly add an OR operator between keywords. You can find more information about the available search operators in the Help page of the results page.</p><p>Datafari is equipped with an autocomplete functionality, that will propose words that are present in the documents, and that start with the characters you are currently typing. This allows you to gain time, and reduce error by seeing only words that do exist in the search index</p>",
  "homepage column 3": "<p>What sources does this Datafari index?</p><p>In this demo, we have indexed an SMB fileshare and two websites. The fileshare contains a corpus from a former utility company, based in the US. So we recommend that you search terms such as “energy”, “utility”, “invoice” or the like. For the websites, we index the Datafari and France Labs websites, so you can search for terms such as “Datafari” or “innovation” for a start.</p><p>Have fun being a Datafarian!</p>",
